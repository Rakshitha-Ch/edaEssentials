Hey there! Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). In this repo, you'll find detailed EDA on two interesting datasets:

 Black Friday Data Analysis: This project dives into customer purchasing behavior during Black Friday sales.

Zomato Data Analysis: Here, I explore restaurant data to uncover insights on dining trends, ratings, and customer experiences.

Project Descriptions
1. Black Friday Data Analysis
Goal: To analyze customer demographics and spending habits during Black Friday sales.

Key Steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values and outliers)

Univariate and bivariate analysis to explore customer demographics and spending behavior

Key insights on age group spending, popular product categories, gender-wise purchasing trends, and more.

Key Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

2. Zomato Data Analysis
Goal: To dig into the Zomato restaurant dataset and uncover patterns in food trends, customer ratings, and service preferences.

Key Steps:

Data cleaning (dropping duplicates, handling missing values)

Feature engineering (creating new variables to uncover deeper insights)

Visual analysis on location, cuisines, cost, and rating distributions

Key insights on popular cuisines, cost brackets, and rating patterns by city

Key Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

 Tech Stack
Python 3

Jupyter Notebook 

Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Insights Highlights

Black Friday: Identified the customer segments that spent the most during the sales event and which product categories saw the highest demand.

Zomato: Discovered the most popular cuisines, the relationship between cost and ratings, and how city-based trends shape dining choices.

Visualized trends using rich, interactive plots for easy understanding.

 Future Work
Black Friday: Plan to build prediction models for estimating purchase amounts based on customer demographics and behavior.

Zomato: Working on creating a restaurant recommendation system based on ratings, cost, and location.
